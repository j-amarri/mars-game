      <h3>Why Mission Mars?</h3>
      <p>COVID 19 has impacted us in 3 major ways:</p>
      <h4>1. Prepare for the future</h4>
      <p>
        It revealed an increasing need to prepare for the future and to start
        thinking in a proactive way, before we are faced with larger issues.
      </p>
      <h4>2. Spice up remote meetings</h4>
      <p>
        Remote collaboration became the norm, carrying with it meeting fatigue
        caused by a never-ending schedule of video calls.
      </p>
      <h4>3. Make team-building fun again</h4>
      <p>
        No more physical team events, making an informal moment to have fun into
        yet another static videocall.
      </p>
      <h4>
        This is why we created a future-inspired game to test new methods for
        remote collaboration.
      </h4>
      <p>
        The Mars One Competition is a gamified service design workshop about
        space exploration, reflecting on todayâ€™s challenges for humanity.
